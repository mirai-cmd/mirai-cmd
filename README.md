I'm Prajwal. I am a Web Developer and Cybersecurity enthusiast. I love computers and technology!! I mostly work with MERN stack web development💻 and Cybersecurity🔐 with a focus on red teaming, however I always find learning new technologies an exciting process!! I’m currently learning VPS hosting on the cloud ☁️

When I'm not coding I play video games🎮, watch anime and have an interest in psychology 🧠. Also I love playing badminton !!🏸

Also I use Arch btw
